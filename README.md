## How do I run this app?

First, install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

After dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by
running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see something like this:

Open <http://localhost:3000> with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page
auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on
<http://localhost:3000/api/hello>. This endpoint can be edited in
`pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are
treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead
of React pages.
